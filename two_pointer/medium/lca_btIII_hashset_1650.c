/* 
* Problem Statement:
* Given two nodes of a binary tree p and q, return their lowest common ancestor (LCA).

Each node will have a reference to its parent node. The definition for Node is below:

class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
}
According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a tree T is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)." 
*/

/*
 * Solution:
 * I solve this problem by treating each node's value as a unique key and using a boolean array to simulate a hash set.
I first walk up from node p, marking all of its ancestors (including itself) in the set.
Then I walk up from node q, and the first ancestor that is already marked is the lowest common ancestor.

ðŸ§  Why It Works
Since all node values are guaranteed to be unique and within the range [-1e9, 1e9], we can safely map them to a flat array using an offset.
This gives us O(1) lookup time, and avoids the overhead of dynamic data structures like hash maps.

    bool* seen = calloc(MAXVAL, sizeof(bool));

    struct Node* curr = p;
    while(curr) {
        seen[curr->val + OFFSET] = true;
        curr = curr->parent;
    }

    curr = q;
    while(curr) {
        if(seen[curr->val + OFFSET]) {
            free(seen);
            return curr;
        }
        curr = curr->parent;
    }

    free(seen);
    return NULL;
